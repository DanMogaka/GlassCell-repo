DATABASE:
Every entry ine database contains the following information:
1. Profile.
   Each profile contains a unqiue keyword and a history of signals.

   Each signal has a chronological index in the profile array. Every signal input includes the date & time
   of the signal, the location, the index of the signal, the healthbar of the signal, and the message
